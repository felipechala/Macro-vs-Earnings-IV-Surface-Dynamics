# Macro-vs-Earnings-IV-Surface-Dynamics
The primary problem addressed by this project is how IV surfaces evolve and revert around major events. The goal is to characterize IV surface shifts (level, skew, curvature) and quantify reversion speeds across both event classes, in order to evaluate which option structures align best with each surface context.
